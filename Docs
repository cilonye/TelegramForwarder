## 6. Automatic Telegram Session Repair

### Problem Solved
- Corrupt `.session` files
- Auth invalidation
- Telegram-side disconnects

### Behavior

On startup:
1. Attempt client.start()
2. If session fails:
   - Log error
   - Delete session file
   - Re-authenticate
   - Continue without manual intervention

This guarantees **self-healing authentication**.
